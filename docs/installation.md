# Installation

MQT Qudits is primarily developed as a C++20 library with Python bindings. The
Python package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits/) and
can be installed on all major operating systems with all
[officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

:::::{tip}
:name: uv-recommendation

We recommend using [{code}`uv`][uv]. It is a fast Python package and project
manager by [Astral](https://astral.sh/) (creators of [{code}`ruff`][ruff]). It
can replace {code}`pip` and {code}`virtualenv`, automatically manages virtual
environments, installs packages, and can install Python itself. It is
significantly faster than {code}`pip`.

If you do not have {code}`uv` installed, install it with:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Linux and macOS

```console
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

:::

:::{tab-item} Windows (PowerShell)

```console
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

:::

::::

See the [uv documentation][uv] for more information.

:::::

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: installer

:::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_
:sync: uv

```console
uv pip install mqt.qudits
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`pip`
:sync: pip

```console
python -m pip install mqt.qudits
```

:::

::::

In most cases, no compilation is required; a platform-specific prebuilt wheel is
downloaded and installed.

Verify the installation:

```console
python -c "import mqt.qudits; print(mqt.qudits.__version__)"
```

This prints the installed package version.

## Building from Source for Performance

To get the best performance and enable platform-specific optimizations not
available in portable wheels, we recommend building the library from source:

::::{tab-set}
:sync-group: installer

:::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_
:sync: uv

```console
uv pip install mqt.qudits --no-binary mqt.qudits
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`pip`
:sync: pip

```console
pip install mqt.qudits --no-binary mqt.qudits
```

:::

::::

This requires a C++20-capable
[C++ compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C++_compilers)
and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.28 or newer.

## Integrating MQT Qudits into Your Project

To use the MQT Qudits Python package in your project, add it as a dependency in
your {code}`pyproject.toml` or {code}`setup.py`. This ensures the package is
installed when your project is installed.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_

```console
uv add mqt.qudits
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`pyproject.toml`

```toml
[project]
# ...
dependencies = ["mqt.qudits>=<version>"]
# ...
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`setup.py`

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    # ...
    install_requires=["mqt.qudits>=<version>"],
    # ...
)
```

:::

::::

If you want to integrate the C++ library directly into your project, you can
either

- add it as a [{code}`git` submodule][git-submodule] and build it as part of
  your project, or
- install MQT Qudits on your system and use CMake's {code}`find_package()`
  command to locate it, or
- use CMake's [{code}`FetchContent`][FetchContent] module to combine both
  approaches.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} {code}`FetchContent`

This is the recommended approach because it lets you detect installed versions
of MQT Qudits and only downloads the library if it is not available on the
system. Furthermore, CMake's [{code}`FetchContent`][FetchContent] module
provides flexibility in how the library is integrated into the project.

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
set(FETCH_PACKAGES "")

# cmake-format: off
set(MQT_QUDITS_MINIMUM_VERSION "<minimum_version>"
    CACHE STRING "MQT Qudits minimum version")
set(MQT_QUDITS_VERSION "<version>"
    CACHE STRING "MQT Qudits version")
set(MQT_QUDITS_REV "<revision>"
    CACHE STRING "MQT Qudits identifier (tag, branch or commit hash)")
set(MQT_QUDITS_REPO_OWNER "munich-quantum-toolkit"
    CACHE STRING "MQT Qudits repository owner (change when using a fork)")
# cmake-format: on
FetchContent_Declare(
  mqt-qudits
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/${MQT_QUDITS_REPO_OWNER}/qudits.git
  GIT_TAG ${MQT_QUDITS_REV}
  FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS ${MQT_QUDITS_MINIMUM_VERSION})
list(APPEND FETCH_PACKAGES mqt-qudits)

# Make all declared dependencies available.
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(${FETCH_PACKAGES})
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`git-submodule`

Adding the library as a [{code}`git` submodule][git-submodule] is a simple
approach. However, {code}`git` submodules can be cumbersome, especially when
working with multiple branches or versions of the library. First, add the
submodule to your project (e.g., in the {code}`external` directory):

```console
git submodule add https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits.git external/mqt-qudits
```

Then add the following line to your {code}`CMakeLists.txt` to make the library's
targets available in your project:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(external/mqt-qudits)
```

:::

:::{tab-item} {code}`find_package()`

You can install MQT Qudits on your system after building it from source:

```console
git clone https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits.git mqt-qudits
cd mqt-qudits
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

Then, in your project's {code}`CMakeLists.txt`, use {code}`find_package()` to
locate the installed library:

```cmake
find_package(mqt-qudits <version> REQUIRED)
```

## Development Setup

Set up a reproducible development environment for MQT Qudits. This is the
recommended starting point for both bug fixes and new features. For detailed
guidelines and workflows, see {doc}`contributing`.

1. Get the code: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   ::::{tab-set}

   :::{tab-item} External Contribution

   If you do not have write access to the
   [munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits)
   repository, fork the repository on GitHub (see
   <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>) and clone
   your fork locally.

   ```console
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/qudits.git mqt-qudits
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} Internal Contribution

   If you have write access to the
   [munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits)
   repository, clone the repository locally.

   ```console
   git clone git@github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits.git mqt-qudits
   ```

   :::

   ::::

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```console
   cd mqt-qudits
   ```

3. Create a branch for local development:

   ```console
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. Install the project and its development dependencies: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   We highly recommend using modern, fast tooling for the development workflow.
   We recommend using [{code}`uv`][uv].
   If you don't have {code}`uv`,
   follow the installation instructions in the recommendation above
   (see {ref}`tip above <uv-recommendation>`).
   See the [uv documentation][uv] for more information.

   ::::{tab-set}
   :sync-group: installer

   :::{tab-item} {code}`uv` _(recommended)_
   :sync: uv

   Install the project (including development dependencies) with [{code}`uv`][uv]:

   ```console
   uv sync
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} {code}`pip`
   :sync: pip

   If you really don't want to use [{code}`uv`][uv], you can install the project
   and the development dependencies into a virtual environment using
   {code}`pip`.

   ```console
   python -m venv .venv
   source ./.venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install -U pip
   python -m pip install -e . --group dev
   ```

   :::

   ::::

5. Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality: <!-- rumdl-disable-line MD013 -->

   The project uses pre-commit hooks for running linters and formatting tools on each commit.
   These checks can be run manually via [{code}`nox`][nox], by running:

   ```console
   nox -s lint
   ```

   They can also be run automatically on every commit via [{code}`prek`][prek] (recommended). To set
   this up, install {code}`prek`, e.g., via:

   ::::{tab-set}

   :::{tab-item} Linux and macOS

   ```console
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.sh | sh
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} Windows (PowerShell)

   ```console
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://github.com/j178/prek/releases/latest/download/prek-installer.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   :::

   :::{tab-item} {code}`uv`

   ```console
   uv tool install prek
   ```

   :::

   ::::

   Then run:

   ```console
   prek install
   ```
