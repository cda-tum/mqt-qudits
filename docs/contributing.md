# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MQT Qudits! This document
outlines the development guidelines and how to contribute.

We use GitHub to [host code](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits),
to [track issues and feature requests][issues], as well as accept
[pull requests](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/pulls). See
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart> for a general introduction
to working with GitHub and contributing to projects.

## Types of Contributions

Pick the path that fits your time and interests:

- 🐛 Report bugs:

  Use the _🐛 Bug report_ template at
  <https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/issues>. Include steps to
  reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment, and a minimal example.

- 🛠️ Fix bugs:

  Browse [issues][issues], especially those labeled "bug", "help wanted", or
  "good first issue". Open a draft PR early to get feedback.

- 💡 Propose features:

  Use the _✨ Feature request_ template at
  <https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/issues>. Describe the
  motivation, alternatives considered, and (optionally) a small API sketch.

- ✨ Implement features:

  Pick items labeled "feature" or "enhancement". Coordinate in the issue first
  if the change is substantial; start with a draft PR.

- 📝 Improve documentation:

  Add or refine docstrings, tutorials, and examples; fix typos; clarify
  explanations. Small documentation-only PRs are very welcome.

- ⚡️ Performance and reliability:

  Profile hot paths, add benchmarks, reduce allocations, deflake tests, and
  improve error messages.

- 📦 Packaging and tooling:

  Improve build configuration, type hints/stubs, CI workflows, and platform
  wheels. Incremental tooling fixes have a big impact.

- 🙌 Community support:

  Triage issues, reproduce reports, and answer questions in Discussions:
  <https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/discussions>.

## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines to help the project grow sustainably.
Contributions that do not comply with these guidelines or violate our
{doc}`ai_usage` may be rejected without further review.

### Core Guidelines

- ["Commit early and push often"](https://www.worklytics.co/blog/commit-early-push-often).
- Write meaningful commit messages, preferably using
  [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) for additional context.
- Focus on a single feature or bug at a time and only touch relevant files.
  Split multiple features into separate contributions.
- Add tests for new features to ensure they work as intended.
- Document new features.
- Add tests for bug fixes to demonstrate the fix.
- Document your code thoroughly and ensure it is readable.
- Keep your code clean by removing debug statements, leftover comments, and
  unrelated code.
- Check your code for style and linting errors before committing.
- Follow the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes based on code
  reviews.

### AI-assisted contributions

We acknowledge the utility of AI-based coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, OpenAI
Codex, or GitHub Copilot) in modern software development. However, their use
requires a high degree of responsibility and transparency to maintain code
quality and licensing compliance.

Please carefully read and follow our dedicated {doc}`ai_usage` before submitting
any AI-assisted contribution. In short:
**You are responsible for every line of code you submit**, and a
**human must always be in the loop**. Agents may perform coding and GitHub tasks
within an explicitly authorized scope, but you must review their work and remain
accountable for the result. Every agent-authored or agent-edited public text
body must begin with `🤖 *AI text below* 🤖`; issue and pull request titles are
exempt. AI assistance must be disclosed in the PR description. Commit-level
`Assisted-by: [Model Name] via [Tool Name]` trailers are recommended for commits
prepared with AI assistance. AI assistance must not be used for contributions to
issues labeled "good first issue".

If you use an agent, it will automatically read the provided {code}`AGENTS.md`,
which contains context and instructions to help the agent work on MQT Qudits.
For Claude Code, create a symlink with {code}`ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` so
Claude picks up the same file.

### Pull Request Workflow

- Create PRs early. Work-in-progress PRs are welcome; mark them as drafts on
  GitHub.
- Use a clear title, reference related issues by number, and describe the
  changes. Follow the PR template; only omit the issue reference if not
  applicable.
- Draft PRs may use a reduced test matrix, while all other CI checks still run.
  Converting a draft to a regular PR triggers the full test matrix.
- After the full test matrix passes, request a review from a maintainer. If
  unsure, ask in the PR comments. If you are a first-time contributor, mention a
  maintainer in a comment to request a review.
- If your PR gets a "Changes requested" review, address the feedback and push
  updates to the same branch. Do not close and reopen a new PR. Respond to
  comments to signal that you have addressed the feedback. Do not resolve review
  comments yourself; the reviewer will do so once satisfied.
- If the reviewer suggested changes with explicit code suggestions as part of
  the comments, apply these directly using the GitHub UI. This attributes the
  changes to the reviewer and automatically resolves the respective comments
  (this is an exception to the rule above). If there are multiple suggestions
  that you want to apply at once, you can batch them into a single commit. Go to
  the "Files changed" tab of the PR, and then click "Add suggestion to batch"
  for each suggestion you want to include. Once you are done selecting
  suggestions, click "Commit suggestions". Only apply suggestions manually if
  using the GitHub UI is not feasible.
- Re-request a review after pushing changes that address feedback.
- Do not squash commits locally; maintainers typically squash on merge. Avoid
  rebasing or force-pushing before reviews; you may rebase after addressing
  feedback if desired.

### Working with CodeRabbit

We often use [CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/) for the initial review of
PRs. We use this tool to ease the workload on our maintainers and to counteract
the trend of sloppy AI-assisted contributions.

Once your PR is ready, an initial review by CodeRabbit can be requested via
{code}`@coderabbitai full review`. Just post this command as a PR comment on
GitHub. Any subsequent reviews can be requested via
{code}`@coderabbitai review`.

To get the most out of it and help the project maintain its high ambitions for
code quality, please follow these practices:

- **Review the review**: Do not take CodeRabbit's suggestions as absolute truth.
  LLMs can be overly defensive and conservative, leading to overcomplicated
  code. Treat its comments as suggestions: consider them, but feel free to
  disagree and explain why.
- **Respond to comments**: Do not simply resolve CodeRabbit's comments without
  answering them. It learns from your replies and improves over time. If a
  suggestion does not apply, take a moment to explain why in a reply.
- **Avoid multiple AI review bots**: CodeRabbit performs significantly worse
  when other AI review bots (e.g., GitHub Copilot) are active on the same PR.
  For the best results, do not tag Copilot unless you have already iterated with
  CodeRabbit and want an extra pass.
- **Engage CodeRabbit in discussions**: When team members are discussing code in
  PR comments, CodeRabbit stays silent by default. Tag {code}`@coderabbitai` to
  engage it in the conversation and get its feedback on the specific points
  being discussed. In particular, when you tag another person in a comment,
  ensure to also tag CodeRabbit. Otherwise, you will just get an automatic "It
  seems like the humans are having a chat" response from CodeRabbit anyway,
  which does not add much value.
- **Let CodeRabbit resolve comments**: Wait until after the next push before
  considering resolving CodeRabbit's comments manually. CodeRabbit will
  automatically resolve comments that it thinks have been addressed by your
  changes. Sometimes, it gets stuck, at which point you may resolve it manually.

Note that having your PR reviewed by CodeRabbit does **not** count as an
AI-assisted contribution for the purpose of the disclosure requirement mentioned
above.

## Get Started 🎉

Ready to contribute? We value contributions from people with all levels of
experience. In particular, if this is your first PR, not everything has to be
perfect. We will guide you through the process.

## Installation

Check out our {ref}`installation guide for developers <development-setup>` for
instructions on how to set up your development environment.

## Working on the C++ Library

Building the project requires a C++20-capable
[C++ compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C++_compilers)
and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.28 or newer. As of August 2025, our CI
pipeline on GitHub continuously tests the library across the following matrix of
systems and compilers:

- {code}`ubuntu-24.04`: {code}`Release` and {code}`Debug` builds using
  {code}`gcc`
- {code}`ubuntu-24.04-arm`: {code}`Release` build using {code}`gcc`
- {code}`macos-26`: {code}`Release` and {code}`Debug` builds using
  {code}`AppleClang`
- {code}`windows-2025`: {code}`Release` and {code}`Debug` builds using
  {code}`msvc`
- {code}`windows-11-arm`: {code}`Release` build using {code}`msvc`

To access the latest build logs, visit the
[GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits/actions/workflows/ci.yml).

We are not aware of any issues with other compilers or operating systems. If you
encounter any problems, please [open an issue][issues] and let us know.

### Configure and Build

:::{tip}
We recommend using an IDE like [CLion][clion] or [VS Code][vscode] for
development. Both IDEs have excellent support for CMake projects and provide a
convenient way to run CMake and build the project. If you prefer to work on the
command line, the following instructions will guide you through the process.
:::

This project uses CMake as the main build configuration tool. To standardize the
configuration, we provide
[CMake presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html).

Building a project using CMake is a two-stage process. First, CMake needs to be
_configured_ by calling:

```console
cmake --preset release
```

Under the hood, this effectively calls
`cmake -S . -B build/release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` and configures
a {code}`Release` build. A {code}`Debug` build can be requested by using the
{code}`debug` preset. Both presets use Ninja on all platforms, including
Windows. Make sure {code}`ninja` is installed and available on {code}`PATH`. On
Windows with MSVC, run these commands from a Visual Studio developer shell.

After configuring CMake, the project can be _built_ by calling:

```console
cmake --build --preset release
```

This command is equivalent to `cmake --build build/release`. The flag
{code}`--parallel <NUMBER_OF_THREADS>` may be added to trigger a parallel build.

Building the project this way generates

- the main project libraries in the {code}`build/release/src` directory and
- some test executables in the {code}`build/release/test` directory.

:::{note}

This project uses CMake's
[{code}`FetchContent`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)
module to download and build its dependencies. Because of this, the first time
you configure the project, you will need an active internet connection to fetch
the required libraries.

However, there are several ways to bypass these downloads:

- **Use system-installed dependencies**: If the dependencies are already
  installed on your system and Find-modules exist for them, {code}`FetchContent`
  will use those versions instead of downloading them.
- **Provide a local copy**: If you have local copies of the dependencies (from a
  previous build or another project), you can point {code}`FetchContent` to them
  by passing the
  [{code}`-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<uppercaseName>`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#variable:FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_%3CuppercaseName%3E)
  flag to your CMake configure step. The {code}`<uppercaseName>` should be
  replaced with the name of the dependency as specified in the project's CMake
  files.
- **Use project-specific options**: Some projects provide specific CMake options
  to use a system-wide dependency instead of downloading it. Check the project's
  documentation or CMake files for these types of flags.

:::

### Running the C++ Tests and Code Coverage

We use the [GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html)
framework for unit testing of the C++ library. All tests are contained in the
{code}`test` directory, which is further divided into subdirectories for
different parts of the library. You are expected to write tests for any new
features you implement and ensure that all tests pass. Our CI pipeline on GitHub
will also run the tests and check for any failures.

Most IDEs like [CLion][clion] or [VS Code][vscode] provide a convenient way to
run the tests directly from the IDE. If you prefer to run the tests from the
command line, you can use CMake's test runner
[CTest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html). To run the
tests, run the following command from the main project directory after building
the project as described above:

```console
ctest --preset release
```

:::{tip}
If you want to disable configuring and building the C++ tests, you can pass
{code}`-DBUILD_MQT_QUDITS_TESTS=OFF` to the CMake configure step.
:::

Our CI pipeline on GitHub also collects code coverage information and uploads it
to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/munich-quantum-toolkit/qudits). Our goal is
to have new contributions at least maintain the current code coverage level,
while striving for covering as much of the code as possible. Try to write
meaningful tests that actually test the correctness of the code and not just
exercise the code paths.

If you want to enable coverage locally, you can use the `coverage` preset:

```console
cmake --preset coverage
cmake --build --preset coverage
ctest --preset coverage
```

### C++ Code Formatting and Linting

This project mostly follows the
[LLVM Coding Standard](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html), which is a
set of guidelines for writing C++ code. To ensure the quality of the code and
that it conforms to these guidelines, we use:

- [`clang-tidy`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/), a static analysis
  tool that checks for common mistakes in C++ code, and
- [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html), a tool that
  automatically formats C++ code according to a given style guide.

Common IDEs like [CLion][clion] or [VS Code][vscode] have plugins that can
automatically run {code}`clang-tidy` on the code and automatically format it
with {code}`clang-format`.

- If you are using CLion, you can configure the project to use the
  {code}`.clang-tidy` and {code}`.clang-format` files in the project root
  directory.
- If you are using [VS Code][vscode], you can install the
  [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).

They will automatically execute {code}`clang-tidy` on your code and highlight
any issues. In many cases, they also provide quick-fixes for these issues.
Furthermore, they provide a command to automatically format your code according
to the given style.

:::{note}

After configuring CMake with the `lint` preset, you can run {code}`clang-tidy`
on a file by calling the following command:

```console
clang-tidy <FILE> -- -I <PATH_TO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORY>
```

Here, {code}`<FILE>` is the file you want to analyze and
{code}`<PATH_TO_INCLUDE_DIRECTORY>` is the path to the {code}`include` directory
of the project.

:::

Our [{code}`prek`][prek] configuration also includes {code}`clang-format`. If
you have installed {code}`prek`, it will automatically run {code}`clang-format`
on your code before each commit. If you do not have {code}`prek` set up, the
[pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) bot will run {code}`clang-format` on your
code and automatically format it according to the style guide.

:::{tip}
Remember to pull the changes back into your local repository after the bot has
formatted your code to avoid merge conflicts.
:::

Our CI pipeline will also run {code}`clang-tidy` over the changes in your PR and
report any issues it finds. Due to technical limitations, the workflow can only
post PR comments if the changes are not coming from a fork. If you are working
on a fork, you can still see the {code}`clang-tidy` results either in the GitHub
Actions logs, on the workflow summary page, or in the "Files changed" tab of the
PR.

### C++ Documentation

Historically, the C++ part of the code base has not been sufficiently
documented. Given the substantial size of the code base, we have set ourselves
the goal to improve the documentation over time. We expect any new additions to
the code base to be documented using
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) comments. When touching existing
code, we encourage you to add Doxygen comments to the code you touch or
refactor.

For some tips on how to write good Doxygen comments, see the
[Doxygen Manual](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html).

The C++ API documentation is integrated into the overall documentation that we
host on ReadTheDocs using the
[breathe](https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extension for Sphinx.

See {ref}`working-on-documentation` for more information on how to build the
documentation.

## Working on the Python Package

We use [{code}`nanobind`](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/) to expose large
parts of the C++ core library to Python. This allows us to keep the
performance-critical parts of the code in C++ while providing a convenient
interface for Python users. All code related to C++-Python bindings is contained
in the {code}`bindings` directory.

:::{tip}

To build only the Python bindings, pass {code}`-DBUILD_MQT_QUDITS_BINDINGS=ON`
to the CMake configure step. CMake will then try to find Python and the
necessary dependencies ({code}`nanobind`) on your system and configure the
respective targets. In [CLion][clion], you can enable an option to pass the
current Python interpreter to CMake. Go to {code}`Preferences` ->
{code}`Build, Execution, Deployment` -> {code}`CMake` ->
{code}`Python Integration` and check the box
{code}`Pass Python Interpreter to CMake`. Alternatively, you can pass
{code}`-DPython_ROOT_DIR=<PATH_TO_PYTHON>` to the configure step to point CMake
to a specific Python installation.

:::

The Python package itself lives in the {code}`python/mqt/qudits` directory.

The package lives in the {code}`src/mqt/qudits` directory.

We recommend using [{code}`nox`][nox] for development. {code}`nox` is a Python
automation tool that allows you to define tasks in a {code}`noxfile.py` file and
then run them with a single command. If you have not installed it yet, see our
{ref}`installation guide for developers <development-setup>`.

We define some convenient {code}`nox` sessions in our {code}`noxfile.py`:

- {code}`tests` to run the Python tests
- {code}`minimums` to run the Python tests with the minimum dependencies
- {code}`lint` to run the Python code formatting and linting
- {code}`docs` to build the documentation
- {code}`stubs` to regenerate the type stub files for the Python bindings

These are explained in more detail in the following sections.

## Running the Python Tests

The Python code is tested by unit tests using the
[{code}`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework. The
corresponding test files can be found in the {code}`test/python` directory. A
{code}`nox` session is provided to conveniently run the Python tests.

```console
nox -s tests
```

This command automatically builds the project and runs the tests on all
supported Python versions. For each Python version, it will create a virtual
environment (in the {code}`.nox` directory) and install the project into it. We
take extra care to install the project without build isolation so that rebuilds
are typically very fast.

If you only want to run the tests on a specific Python version, you can pass the
desired Python version to the {code}`nox` command.

```console
nox -s tests-3.14
```

:::{note}

If you do not want to use {code}`nox`, you can also run the tests directly using
{code}`pytest`. This requires that you have the project and its test
dependencies installed in your virtual environment (e.g., by running
{code}`uv sync`).

```console
pytest
```

:::

We provide an additional nox session {code}`minimums` that makes use of
{code}`uv`'s {code}`--resolution=lowest-direct` flag to install the lowest
possible versions of the direct dependencies. This ensures that the project can
still be built and the tests pass with the minimum required versions of the
dependencies.

```console
nox -s minimums
```

## Python Code Formatting and Linting

The Python code is formatted and linted using a collection of pre-commit hooks.
This collection includes

- [ruff][ruff], an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust,
  and
- [ty][ty], Astral's type checker for Python.

The hooks can be installed by running the following command in the root
directory:

```console
prek install
```

This will install the hooks in the {code}`.git/hooks` directory of the
repository. The hooks will be executed whenever you commit changes.

You can also run the {code}`nox` session {code}`lint` to run the hooks manually.

```console
nox -s lint
```

:::{note}

If you do not want to use {code}`nox`, you can also run the hooks manually by
using [{code}`prek`][prek].

```console
prek run --all-files
```

:::

## Python Documentation

The Python code is documented using
[Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings).
Every public function, class, and module should have a docstring that explains
what it does and how to use it. {code}`ruff` will check for missing docstrings
and will explicitly warn you if you forget to add one.

We heavily rely on [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
to document the expected types of function arguments and return values. For the
compiled parts of the code base, we provide type hints in the form of stub files
in the {code}`python/mqt/qudits` directory. These stub files are auto-generated.
Do not edit them directly. Instead, you can use the {code}`nox` session
{code}`stubs` to regenerate them automatically.

```console
nox -s stubs
```

The Python API documentation is integrated into the overall documentation that
we host on ReadTheDocs using the
[{code}`sphinx-autoapi`](https://sphinx-autoapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
extension for Sphinx.

(working-on-documentation)=

## Working on the Documentation

The documentation is written in
[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (a flavor of
Markdown) and built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The
documentation source files can be found in the {code}`docs/` directory.

Tutorials use [MyST-NB](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) Markdown notebooks.
Only `{code-cell}` blocks in notebook pages execute; ordinary code fences are
illustrative. Keep required setup visible, show useful output, and assert the
behavior that each example demonstrates. Use local simulation for executable
examples; leave credentials and remote-device deployment as configuration
recipes.

Use the documentation session to install Python dependencies, build the package
and generated references, and render the examples:

```console
uvx nox --non-interactive -s docs
```

Install the project's native build requirements first. C++ API generation needs
Doxygen; DD visualizations also need the Graphviz `dot` executable. The session
manages Python packages, not these system tools.

Omit `--non-interactive` to serve the documentation while editing. To check
external links, run:

```console
uvx nox --non-interactive -s docs -- -b linkcheck
```

## Tips for Development

If something goes wrong, the CI pipeline will notify you. Here are some tips for
finding the cause of certain failures:

- If any of the {code}`CI / 🇨 Test` checks fail, this indicates build errors or
  test failures in the C++ part of the code base. Look through the respective
  logs on GitHub for any error or failure messages.

- If any of the {code}`CI / 🐍 Test` checks fail, this indicates build errors or
  test failures in the Python part of the code base. Look through the respective
  logs on GitHub for any error or failure messages.

- If any of the {code}`codecov/\*` checks fail, this means that your changes are
  not appropriately covered by tests or that the overall project coverage
  decreased too much. Ensure that you include tests for all your changes in the
  PR.

- If {code}`cpp-linter` comments on your PR with a list of warnings, these have
  been raised by {code}`clang-tidy` when checking the C++ part of your changes
  for warnings or style guideline violations. The individual messages frequently
  provide helpful suggestions on how to fix the warnings. If you don't see any
  messages, but the {code}`🇨 Lint / 🚨 Lint` check is red, click on the
  {code}`Details` link to see the full log of the check and a step summary.

- If the {code}`pre-commit.ci` check fails, some of the {code}`prek` checks
  failed and could not be fixed automatically by the
  [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) bot. The individual log messages
  frequently provide helpful suggestions on how to fix the warnings.

- If the {code}`docs/readthedocs.org:\*` check fails, the documentation could
  not be built properly. Inspect the corresponding log file for any errors.

## Releasing a New Version

Before releasing a new version, check the GitHub release draft generated by the
Release Drafter for unlabelled PRs. Unlabelled PRs would appear at the top of
the release draft below the main heading. Furthermore, check whether the version
number in the release draft is correct. The version number in the release draft
is dictated by the presence of certain labels on the PRs involved in a release.
By default, a patch release will be created. If any PR has the {code}`minor` or
{code}`major` label, a minor or major release will be created, respectively.

:::{note}

Sometimes, Dependabot or Renovate will tag a PR updating a dependency with a
{code}`minor` or {code}`major` label because the dependency update itself is a
minor or major release. This does not mean that the dependency update itself is
a breaking change for MQT Qudits. If you are sure that the dependency update
does not introduce any breaking changes for MQT Qudits, you can remove the
{code}`minor` or {code}`major` label from the PR. This will ensure that the
respective PR does not influence the type of an upcoming release.
