# MQT Qudits - A Framework For Mixed-Dimensional Qudit Quantum Computing

MQT Qudits is an open-source C++17 and Python framework for mixed-dimensional qudit quantum computing developed as part of the {doc}`Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) <mqt:index>` by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/).

:::{note}
**The tool is in an experimental stage, which is subject to frequent changes, and has limited documentation.**
We are working on improving that.
In the meantime, users can explore how to use the framework via a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qudits/blob/main/MQT%20Tutorial/MQT%20Qudits%20Tutorial.ipynb), showcasing its main functionality.

Furthermore, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=due_CX7H85A) briefly illustrates some of the functionalities of MQT Qudits.
