(.venv) $ pip install -ve .
+++

```{note}
This requires a C++17 compiler, a minimum CMake version of 3.19, and Python 3.9+.
````

## User Inputs

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

from mqt.qudits.quantum_circuit import QuantumCircuit
```

### **New QASM Extension:**

Dive into a language meticulously designed to express quantum algorithms and circuits.
MQT Qudits extends the OpenQASM 2.0 grammar, effortlessly adapting to mixed-dimensional registers.
In the following, a **DITQASM** program is explicitly written, although several methods for importing programs from files are present in the library.

```{code-cell} ipython3
qasm = """
    DITQASM 2.0;

    qreg field [7][5,5,5,5,5,5,5];
    qreg matter [2];

    creg meas_matter[7];
    creg meas_fields[3];

    h matter[0] ctl field[0] field[1] [0,0];
    cx field[2], matter[0];
    cx field[2], matter[1];
    rxy (0, 1, pi, pi/2) field[3];

    measure q[0] -> meas[0];
    measure q[1] -> meas[1];
    measure q[2] -> meas[2];
    """
```

A new feature is the **control syntax**:

```text
_operation_   __ctl__  _quditline_  [list of qudit control levels]
```

We can import the DITQASM program and construct a quantum circuit.

```{code-cell} ipython3
circuit = QuantumCircuit()
circuit.from_qasm(qasm)

print(f"Number of operations: {len(circuit.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {circuit.num_qudits}")
print(f"Dimensions: {circuit.dimensions}")
```

### **Python Interface**

Constructing and manipulating quantum programs becomes a breeze with Python. You have the flexibility to:

1. **Initialize Quantum Circuits:** Start by creating your quantum circuits effortlessly.

2. **Create Quantum Registers:** Build dedicated quantum registers tailored to your needs.

3. **Compose Circuits:** Seamlessly bring together your quantum registers, forming a unified and powerful circuit.

4. **Apply Operations:** Easily apply a variety of qudit operations, without worrying about the right representation.

Let's construct a quantum circuit from scratch, with the python interface.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.quantum_circuit import QuantumRegister

circuit = QuantumCircuit()

field_reg = QuantumRegister("fields", 1, [7])
matter_reg = QuantumRegister("matter", 1, [2])

circuit.append(field_reg)
circuit.append(matter_reg)

print(f"Number of operations: {len(circuit.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {circuit.num_qudits}")
print(f"Gate set: {circuit.gate_set}")
```

No operations were inserted yet, let's take a look at how operations can be applied!

The size of every line is detected automatically and the right operations are applied to the right qudits

```{code-cell} ipython3
circuit.h(field_reg[0])
circuit.csum([field_reg[0], matter_reg[0]])

print(f"Number of operations: {len(circuit.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {circuit.num_qudits}")
```

It is possible to export the code as well and share your program in a QASM file.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(circuit.to_qasm())
```

Let's save the circuit to a file

```{code-cell} ipython3
file = circuit.save_to_file("my_circuit", ".")
```

and load it back

```{code-cell} ipython3
circuit.load_from_file(file)

print("Program:", circuit.to_qasm(), sep="\n")
print("Dimensions: ", circuit.dimensions)
```

Custom gates can be added to the circuit as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
n = 5
random_matrix = np.random.randn(n, n) + 1j * np.random.randn(n, n)

Q, R = np.linalg.qr(random_matrix)

unitary_matrix = Q
cu = circuit.cu_one(field_reg[0], unitary_matrix)
```

Gates follow the order:

- target qudit/s : list or single number
- parameters list with order lower level, upper level, control level, theta, phi
- control data

A simple qudit gate can be added as follows:

```{code-cell} ipython3
r = circuit.r(field_reg[0], [0, 1, np.pi / 5, np.pi / 7])
```

Operations can also be controlled by other qudits, as shown below:

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.quantum_circuit.gate import ControlData

r_c1 = circuit.r(field_reg[0], [0, 1, np.pi / 5, np.pi / 7], ControlData([matter_reg[0]], [1]))
```

or as

```{code-cell} ipython3
r_c2 = circuit.r(field_reg[0], [0, 1, np.pi / 5, np.pi / 7]).control([matter_reg[0]], [1])
```

The representation of the matrix corresponding to a gate is dynamic:

- 0: no identities
- 1: identities in between long-range gates are introduced
- 2: full circuit unitary

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"Gate matrix for {r._name}:", r.to_matrix(0), sep="\n")
```

The inverse of any gate can easily be obtained.

```{code-cell} ipython3
rd = r.dag()
print(f"Inverse gate matrix for {r._name}:", rd.to_matrix(0), sep="\n")
```

The control information can be accessed as well.

```{code-cell} ipython3
r_c1.control_info
```

Two- and multi-qudit gates follow the rule:

- two : target_qudits first is control, second is target
- multi: all are controls, except last one is target

```{code-cell} ipython3
r_c1.reference_lines
```

## Simulation

After crafting your quantum circuit with precision, take it for a spin using two distinct engines, each flaunting its unique set of data structures.

- **External Tensor-Network Simulator:** Delve into the quantum realm with a robust external tensor-network simulator. Can simulate all the gate-set.

- **MiSiM (C++-Powered):** Unleash the power of decision-diagram-based simulation with MiSiM, seamlessly interfaced with Python for a fluid and efficient experience. Can only simulate the machine following machine gate set:

  - csum
  - cx
  - h
  - rxy
  - rz
  - rh
  - virtrz
  - s
  - x
  - z

### Basic Simulation

```{code-cell} ipython3
circuit = QuantumCircuit()

field_reg = QuantumRegister("fields", 1, [3])
matter_reg = QuantumRegister("matter", 1, [3])

circuit.append(field_reg)
circuit.append(matter_reg)

h = circuit.h(field_reg[0])
csum = circuit.csum([field_reg[0], matter_reg[0]])

print(f"Number of operations: {len(circuit.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {circuit.num_qudits}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.simulation import MQTQuditProvider

provider = MQTQuditProvider()
provider.backends("sim")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.visualisation import plot_counts, plot_state

backend = provider.get_backend("tnsim")

job = backend.run(circuit)
result = job.result()

state_vector = result.get_state_vector()

plot_state(state_vector, circuit)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
backend = provider.get_backend("misim")

job = backend.run(circuit)
result = job.result()

state_vector = result.get_state_vector()

plot_state(state_vector, circuit)
```

### Extending Engines with Noise Model and Properties for FakeBackend

Enhance your quantum simulation experience by extending the engines with a noise model and incorporating various properties.
By combining a noise model and carefully tuned properties, you can craft a FakeBackend that closely emulates the performance of the best quantum machines in experimental laboratories.
This allows for more realistic and insightful quantum simulations.

Experiment, iterate, and simulate quantum circuits with the sophistication of real-world conditions, all within the controlled environment of your simulation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.simulation.noise_tools.noise import Noise, NoiseModel

# Depolarizing quantum errors
local_error = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.001, probability_dephasing=0.001)
local_error_rz = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.03, probability_dephasing=0.03)

entangling_error = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.1, probability_dephasing=0.001)
entangling_error_extra = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.1, probability_dephasing=0.1)

entangling_error_on_target = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.1, probability_dephasing=0.0)
entangling_error_on_control = Noise(probability_depolarizing=0.01, probability_dephasing=0.0)

# Add errors to noise_tools model

noise_model = NoiseModel()  # We know that the architecture is only two qudits
# Very noisy gate
noise_model.add_all_qudit_quantum_error(local_error, ["csum"])
noise_model.add_recurrent_quantum_error_locally(local_error, ["csum"], [0])
# Entangling gates
noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error(entangling_error, ["cx", "ls", "ms"])
noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error_on_target(entangling_error_on_target, ["cx", "ls", "ms"])
noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error_on_control(entangling_error_on_control, ["csum", "cx", "ls", "ms"])
# Super noisy Entangling gates
noise_model.add_nonlocal_quantum_error(entangling_error_extra, ["csum"])
# Local Gates
noise_model.add_quantum_error_locally(local_error, ["h", "rxy", "s", "x", "z"])
noise_model.add_quantum_error_locally(local_error_rz, ["rz", "virtrz"])

print(noise_model.quantum_errors)
```

We can set the noise model for the simulation, but also set several other flags:

- `shots`: number of shots for the stochastic simulation
- `memory`: flag for saving shots (True/False)
- `full_state_memory`: save the full noisy states
- `file_path`: file path of the h5 database storing the data
- `file_name`: name of the file

```{code-cell} ipython3
backend = provider.get_backend("tnsim")

job = backend.run(circuit, noise_model=noise_model)

result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()

plot_counts(counts, circuit)
```

You can also invoke a fake backend and retrieve a few relevant properties, that are already embedded in them

```{code-cell} ipython3
provider = MQTQuditProvider()
provider.backends("fake")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
backend_ion = provider.get_backend("faketraps2trits", shots=1000)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

mapping = backend_ion.energy_level_graphs

pos = nx.circular_layout(mapping[0])
nx.draw(mapping[0], pos, with_labels=True, node_size=2000, node_color="lightblue", font_size=12, font_weight="bold")
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
job = backend_ion.run(circuit)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()

plot_counts(counts, circuit)
```

## Compilation

Tailor your quantum compilation process to achieve optimal performance and emulate the intricacies of experimental setups.

### Compiler Customization with Modern Passes

1. **Optimization Strategies:** Implement specific optimization strategies based on your quantum algorithm's characteristics. Fine-tune compilation for better resource utilization and reduced gate counts.

2. **Gate Decomposition:** Customize gate decomposition techniques to match the capabilities of experimental quantum hardware. Aligning with the native gate set enhances the efficiency of your compiled circuits.

### Experimental-Inspired Compilation

Emulate the features of the best experimental laboratories in your compilation process.
Leverage modern compiler passes to customize optimization, gate decomposition, and noise-aware strategies, creating compiled circuits that closely resemble the challenges and advantages of cutting-edge quantum hardware.

Customize, compile, and push the boundaries of quantum algorithms with a tailored approach to quantum compilation.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.compiler import QuditCompiler
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
qudit_compiler = QuditCompiler()

passes = ["PhyLocQRPass"]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
compiled_circuit_qr = qudit_compiler.compile(backend_ion, circuit, passes)

print(f"Number of operations: {len(compiled_circuit_qr.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {compiled_circuit_qr.num_qudits}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
job = backend_ion.run(compiled_circuit_qr)

result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()

plot_counts(counts, compiled_circuit_qr)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
passes = ["PhyLocAdaPass", "ZPropagationPass", "ZRemovalPass"]

compiled_circuit_ada = qudit_compiler.compile(backend_ion, circuit, passes)

print(f"Number of operations: {len(compiled_circuit_ada.instructions)}")
print(f"Number of qudits in the circuit: {compiled_circuit_ada.num_qudits}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
job = backend_ion.run(compiled_circuit_ada)

result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()

plot_counts(counts, compiled_circuit_ada)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
from mqt.qudits.visualisation import draw_qudit_local

draw_qudit_local(compiled_circuit_ada)
```
