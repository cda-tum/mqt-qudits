# MQT Qudits - A Framework For Mixed-Dimensional Qudit Quantum Computing

MQT Qudits is a framework for research and education for mixed-dimensional qudit
quantum computing. It is part of the
[_Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)_](https://mqt.readthedocs.io).

  </a>
</p>

## Key features

- **Mixed-dimensional quantum circuit support**: Design, simulate, and analyze
  quantum circuits with arbitrary qudit dimensions, not limited to qubits.
  [Tutorial](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits/en/latest/tutorial.html)
- **Python-first API**: Intuitive Python interface for circuit construction,
  simulation, and analysis, with type hints and integration with scientific
  Python libraries.
- **Cross-platform and open-source**: C++20 core with Python bindings, prebuilt
  wheels for Linux, macOS, and Windows via
  [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits/).

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by
the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by
[MQSC](https://mq.sc). Among others, it is part of the
[Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss)
ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the
[Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

`mqt.qudits` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.qudits/).

```console
uv pip install mqt.qudits
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at
[ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits).**

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the functionalities of MQT Qudits are illustrated in
> [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=due_CX7H85A).

## System Requirements and Building

Building the project requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake
3.28 or newer. For details on how to build the project, please refer to the
[documentation](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/qudits). Building (and
running) is continuously tested under Linux, macOS, and Windows using the
[latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
MQT Qudits is compatible with all
[officially supported Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
